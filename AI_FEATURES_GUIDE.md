- **Chat Interface**: Text input area for AI conversations
- **Page Context**: AI awareness of current webpage

## üîß Development Notes

The AI extension includes:
- **Background Script**: `background.js` (handles AI logic)

- **Side Panel**: `sidepanel.html` (main AI interface)
- **Permissions**: Full page access, storage, tabs, debugging

## üìù If AI Still Not Working

The AI features require:
1. **Proper Build**: Extension must be compiled correctly
2. **Chromium Source**: Full build with all patches applied
3. **Component Registration**: Extension must be registered as component
4. **Side Panel Support**: Browser must support side panel API

If you're using a pre-built version and AI isn't working, the build might be incomplete or the AI features might need additional setup.
